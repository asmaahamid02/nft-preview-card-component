## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It was an easy challenge, yet I learned a little bit how to use multiple box shadows.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-shadow: 0 1.5em 0.5em 1em hsla(217, 54%, 11%, 0.6), 0 20px 0.5em 3em hsla(216, 50%, 16%, 0.2);
}
```

### Continued development

I used a div for the overlay, I think I should have used a pseudo element instead. I want to learn more about pseudo elements and how to use them.
